TO-DO:
- Presave tensorflow datasets?
- Upload datasets directly for training (don't store for longer than used)
- Problem with testing and files on AWS not getting deleted
- Reset entire model to build (in task)
- Download entire dataset at once for performance

Start Celery Worker: 
celery -A Dalinar.celery worker --pool=solo -l info -Q default
