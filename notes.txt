TO-DO:
- Presave tensorflow datasets?
- Upload datasets directly for training (don't store for longer than used)
- Problem with testing and files on AWS not getting deleted
- Only use necessary values in GetTaskResult?
- Area dataset models (and look into downloading)

Layers to add:

Start Celery Worker: 
celery -A Dalinar.celery worker --pool=solo -l info -Q default
celery -A Dalinar.celery worker --pool=solo -l info -Q training

Get traing worker log:
1. SSH into AWS instance (see connect)
2a. tail -f /home/ubuntu/celery_default.log
2b. tail -f /home/ubuntu/celery_training.log
