TO-DO:
- Presave tensorflow datasets?
- Upload datasets directly for training (don't store for longer than used)
- Problem with testing and files on AWS not getting deleted
- Look into deleting temp model file in get_tf_model
- Reset entire model to build (in task maybe)

Layers to add:


Start Celery Worker: 
celery -A Dalinar.celery worker --pool=solo -l info -Q default
celery -A Dalinar.celery worker --pool=solo -l info -Q training
