TO-DO:
- Presave tensorflow datasets?
- Upload datasets directly for training (don't store for longer than used)
- alt tag for images
- Regression models
- Problem with testing and files on AWS not getting deleted
- Look into deleting temp model file in get_tf_model
- Maybe look into further styling of dropdowns
